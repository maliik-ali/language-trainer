# DeutschMotivation 

DeutschMotivation is AR App using this app, the user will be able to scan different German books and know which book is more suitable to learn German fast.

The idea behind this app is to help international students who are willing to learn the German language to boost their career level and learn german culture in an efficient way.
However, there are plenty of online resources and books are available in the market. 

But we did not know how much knowledge we get actually after reading the book.
So DeutschMotivation AR app helps users to quickly get an overview of the German book. 

E-g Using this app users will be able to get a quick overview of the book without reading the
whole book.

# DeutschMotivation App Feedback

#### How would you describe your overall experience with the AR/VR application?
Ans: 5- I like it very much

#### Is there anything missed from your point of view
Ans: I wish I had a picture of the app in front of me, so I'm going off of memory here....but if I remember correctly, there was a lot of interesting information that could be (potentially) displayed, but there was a slight lack of information hierarchy. 

As a user, it was hard to tell what was the most important thing I should be looking at (other than the title of the book, which was well-positioned.) What's the most important thing you want the user to focus on? (For me personally, it might be how long I spent studying. 

A big timer that says how long I studied, and a breakdown of what section I spent the most time broken down into smaller sections.) Just an example of what I mean. Other than that it looked like you had a lot of different well-thought-out sections. 

#### On a scale from 1 to 5 (1=not at all likely, 5=very likely), how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?
Ans: 5=Yes


#### What, if anything, surprised you about the experience?
Ans: It's a surprisingly really cool concept. I spend a lot of time with these German learning books (lol) and it would be awesome to close the book and then get an overview of learning statistics after a long study session. I think it's a great idea and I'd be thrilled if such an app existed in real life. 

#### How frequently would you use this product? [Never, Very Rarely (once per month), Rarely (2-3 times/month), Occasionally (2-3 times/week), Frequently (1-2 times/day), Very Frequently (3+ times/day)]
Ans: Occasionally


#### What features should be improved or added?
Ans: This isn't really an issue, but some of the "covers" seemed to use "fake" data which for me lessened the experience of using the app. There was one cover that looked like it had "real" study data on it, which was a much more immersive and enjoyable experience for me. If all of the covers had real looking data on it, it would have made the experience a little more positive.
