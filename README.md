# Language Trainer Introduction

Language Trainer is an augmented reality application that helps people to learn a new language by challenging them to identify objects around them in the language that they want to learn.


# Background
Our brain stores information in a way that is easy to recall because visual images/information have more things that we instantly memorize and recall it easily. In this era where people rely heavily on their smartphones and smart devices to learn everything independently and the mobile applications like Babbel, Duolingo, Fun easy learn have made tremendous progress in the field of language learning. 

# Problem statement
They have taken advantage of visual memory to help users learn a new language that requires very less effort. They use the vector images of food and other items that most users are familiar with and connect them with the word in a foreign language. However, they have made the language learning process far easier than before, but they still fail to engage most users for a longer period of time.

# Solutions
So I recognized this gap and made use of the principles of contextual augmented reality to engage and motivate users to construct their knowledge during real-world observation.

- With the help of the Language Lerner app, the user will be able to Identify any object around them and learn the name of that specific object.
- Build their knowledge during real-world observation.
- Get a quick overview of the language book without reading the whole book. And know which book is more suitable to learn a language fast. for example

✔ How many words the user will learn?

✔ How many sentences the user will learn?

✔ How much time does it take to complete the book?

✔ Which of the skill(Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking) will boost after reading the book?

# Process (User-Centered Design)
### Initial Concept
Finalize idea to design something in the education field.
### Market Research
Research on different learning apps and understand the problem and competitors.
### User Research
After market analysis I conducted many user interviews and create user personas.
### Design and ideation
Then design wireframes and prototypes of the app ideas.
### Implementation & testing
After completing the first draft of the design.  Test app and get feedback on it. (Process repeat)

# Research Key Takeaways

- Need to learn a new language when they move to a place where most people speak in different languages.
- Learning apps don’t provide in-depth knowledge
- Too many reminders and the same kinds of questions

# User Testing & feedback
The purpose of this testing was to garner feedback from users and evaluate what they find confusing or delightful about the app.

#### How would you describe your overall experience with the AR/VR application?
Ans: 5- I like it very much

#### Is there anything missed from your point of view
Ans: I wish I had a picture of the app in front of me, so I'm going off of memory here....but if I remember correctly, there was a lot of interesting information that could be (potentially) displayed, but there was a slight lack of information hierarchy. 

As a user, it was hard to tell what was the most important thing I should be looking at (other than the title of the book, which was well-positioned.) What's the most important thing you want the user to focus on? (For me personally, it might be how long I spent studying. 

A big timer that says how long I studied, and a breakdown of what section I spent the most time broken down into smaller sections.) Just an example of what I mean. Other than that it looked like you had a lot of different well-thought-out sections. 

#### On a scale from 1 to 5 (1=not at all likely, 5=very likely), how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?
Ans: 5=Yes


#### What, if anything, surprised you about the experience?
Ans: It's a surprisingly really cool concept. I spend a lot of time with these German learning books (lol) and it would be awesome to close the book and then get an overview of learning statistics after a long study session. I think it's a great idea and I'd be thrilled if such an app existed in real life. 

#### How frequently would you use this product? [Never, Very Rarely (once per month), Rarely (2-3 times/month), Occasionally (2-3 times/week), Frequently (1-2 times/day), Very Frequently (3+ times/day)]
Ans: Occasionally


#### What features should be improved or added?
Ans: This isn't really an issue, but some of the "covers" seemed to use "fake" data which for me lessened the experience of using the app. There was one cover that looked like it had "real" study data on it, which was a much more immersive and enjoyable experience for me. If all of the covers had real looking data on it, it would have made the experience a little more positive.


# Feedback Implementation and live demo
new screen shot or video


# Future implementation
- Concepts of gamification in order to increase engagement.
